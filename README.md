## Introduction

The STM32F446RE microcontroller from the STM32 family is a powerful platform for embedded system development. This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects that explore various capabilities of the STM32F446RE Nucleo board, including GPIO control, timers, interrupts, communication protocols (SPI, I2C, UART), and more advanced features like PWM generation and ADC usage.

These projects are created using **STM32CubeIDE**, the official development environment provided by STMicroelectronics, ensuring efficient and robust development.

## Hardware Requirements

To work with the projects in this repository, you will need:

- **STM32F446RE Nucleo Board**
- USB cable for programming and communication
- Optional peripheral components like LEDs, buttons, sensors, etc. (specific to each project)
- Breadboard, jumper wires, and other basic electronics tools

---

## Software Requirements

- [**STM32CubeIDE**](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) (version 1.13.0 or later recommended)
- STM32CubeMX (integrated in STM32CubeIDE)
- Optional: [**STM32CubeProgrammer**](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)
- Drivers for the Nucleo board (available on STMicroelectronics' website)
